Header: Types of Renewable Energy Sources
Content: 
1. Solar Energy: Energy derived from the sun through the use of solar panels.
2. Wind Energy: Energy generated by the wind through wind turbines.
3. Hydroelectric Power: Energy produced from flowing water in rivers or dams.
4. Biomass Energy: Energy derived from organic materials like wood, crops, and waste.
5. Geothermal Energy: Energy harnessed from the heat within the Earth's core.
